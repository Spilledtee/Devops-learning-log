** What I Learned Today**
- **Linux Basics:**  
  - Learned what Linux is and how itâ€™s an open-source operating system used for servers, cloud, and DevOps tools.
  - Discovered that Linux comes in different **distributions** (like Ubuntu, CentOS, and Debian).

- **Bash Scripting:**  
  - Got an introduction to Bash scripting, which helps automate tasks on Linux systems.  
  - Found that Bash is essentially a command-line interface (CLI) used to interact with the system.

- **OSI Model and Networking Concepts:**  
  - Explored the OSI Model, which explains how different layers work together to transfer data across networks.
  - **TCP vs. UDP:** Found it challenging to understand the differences between them:
    - **TCP:** Reliable but slower (used for things like emails and web pages).
    - **UDP:** Faster but less reliable (used for video streaming and online games).

## Challenges / Blockers  
- The OSI model was a bit confusing, especially the **Transport Layer** and how **TCP** and **UDP** function differently.

## Resources Used  
- **YouTube**: Videos explaining Linux and OSI model  
- **ChatGPT**: Helped clarify Bash scripting concepts and TCP vs. UDP  

## Next Steps / To-Do List  
- **Install Linux** and explore it further.  
- Start learning **Linux command lines** to navigate and manipulate files.  
- **Explore GitHub** further (installed today).  
  - Learn how to create repositories, commit files, and push code.
