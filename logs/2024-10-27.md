### Today's Progress 🚀  
- **Finished writing an article** on how to set up a Dev Environment using VirtualBox and Ubuntu.  
- Successfully **installed VirtualBox** and created a **new Ubuntu VM**.  
  - Learned how to allocate resources (RAM, storage) and boot Ubuntu inside VirtualBox.
- **Explored using Vagrant** for automating VM setups but still facing **trouble installing it properly**.  
- Tested different terminals on Windows to manage Vagrant and VirtualBox efficiently:  
  - **Command Prompt**  
  - **Windows Terminal**  
  - **Git Bash**  
  - **PowerShell**

### Commands Covered Today  
- `vagrant init` – Initialize a Vagrant project.  
- `vagrant up` – Start the VM using Vagrant.  
- `vagrant ssh` – Log into the VM.  
- `vagrant halt` – Stop the VM.  
- `mkdir` and `cd` – Used to create and navigate directories for the Vagrant project.

### Challenges 😅  
- **Still troubleshooting Vagrant installation issues**. It’s installed, but I’m having some difficulties getting it to work as expected.  
  - Next step: Investigate installation errors or environment setup issues.

### Next Steps ⏭️  
- Debug the **Vagrant installation** and get the first VM running with it.  
- Use the **Ubuntu VM** to explore DevOps tools (e.g., web server with Nginx).  
- Start documenting Vagrant commands and automating some setup tasks with a `Vagrantfile`.
